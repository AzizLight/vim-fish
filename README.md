vim-fish
========

This is an addon for Vim providing filetype support for [fish][] scripts.  In
addition to the normal Vim features such as syntax highlighting, automatic
indentation and filetype detection, this addon includes optional support for
the third-party addons [UltiSnips][], [Syntastic][], [endwise][] and
[commentary][] when any of those are installed.  Bonus feature: if you use Vim
with `funced` in fish the cursor will be placed inside the function and Vim
will enter Insert mode.
